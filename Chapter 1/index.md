| Exercise Number | Exercise Description | Date of completion |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| [EX1-1](ex1-01.c) | Run the "hello, world" program on your system. Experiment with leaving out parts of the program, to see what error messages you get | 7 Dec 2023 |
| [EX1-2](ex1-02.c) | Experiment to find out what happens when printf's argument string contains \c, where c is some character not listed above | 7 Dec 2023 |
| [EX1-3](ex1-03.c) | Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading above the table | 7 Dec 2023 |
| [EX1-4](ex1-04.c) | Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit table | 7 Dec 2023 |
| [EX1-5](ex1-05.c) | Modify the temperature conversion program to print the table in reverse order, that is, from 300 degrees to 0 | 7 Dec 2023 |
| [EX1-6](ex1-06.c) | Verify that the expression getchar() != EOF is 0 or 1 | 7 Dec 2023 |
| [EX1-7](ex1-07.c) | Write a program to print the value of EOF | 7 Dec 2023 |
| [EX1-8](ex1-08.c) | Write a program to count blanks, tabs and newlines | 7 Dec 2023 |
| [EX1-9](ex1-09.c) | Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank | 7 Dec 2023 |
| [EX1-10](ex1-10.c) | Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each tab by \t, each backspace by \b and each backslash by (\). This makes tabs and backspaces visible in an unambiguous way | 7 Dec 2023 |
| [EX1-11](ex1-11.c) | How would you test the word program? What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any? | 7 Dec 2023 |
| [EX1-12](ex1-12.c) | Write a program that prints its input one word per line | 7 Dec 2023 |
| [EX1-13](ex1-13.c) | Write a program to print a histogram of the lenghts of words in its input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging | 7 Dec 2023 |
