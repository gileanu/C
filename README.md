# The C Programming Languadge

This repository will eventually have all the exercises from the book "The C programming language", solved and organized by each Chapter, inside each Chapter there is an index, inside each index there are links to each exercise, the description of the exercise and the date when it was solved (by me).

This will also be an exercise for me to get more comfortable with github, how to write propper documentation, both using Markdown and inside the .c files with comments, using .gitignore to ignore compiled files, librarys, executables, shared objects, headers etc.
